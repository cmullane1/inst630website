It’s at the Glasgow Film Festival theatre, they’re showing a Dementia Friendly Screening of White Christmas. It’s been fully booked over the last few weeks so it’s going to be challenging I’m sure, but fun. I’m on duty as a volunteer and an advisory member of the committee. I’m getting prepared, I’ve got my Santa hat out, I’ve got my Christmas cheer now let the show begin! Merry Christmas everybody and please remember be kind to yourself. Be aware that Christmas cheer is not for everyone and we can get sensory overload. So just retire- my spot seems to be the bathroom, the quietest place in the house- so that you can take some mindful moments, gather your thoughts, be grateful and go out and enjoy what you do. Take Care! Bye for now!" ,

				"FullPost":"Hi this is Dory. This is the 4th silly story of Christmas. It’s hard to think of which one to say because there’s that many of them but I’ll give you my adventures with the pushbike. I had a fold up pushbike, I’d gone to get my Christmas shop. We’re going back years, we didn’t have a car, so I used to go down to my local store on the bike. So off I go to get some of the Christmas shopping. I was coming back up a hill and I had a carrier bag on each handle full of tins and cans of beer, and all sorts. So I was peddling away up this hill and the bike suddenly folded in half. So off went the bags of shopping, the cans were rolling down the hill so I had to leave the bike on the side of the road, and run picking up my shopping. So I don’t know why it folded up, I think I hadn’t tightened the screw enough. So there was that incident, and some people came out of their houses to help me pick the shopping up. And the next incident with the bike, the same bike, I was biking home from Work one evening and the pedals fell off, the whole pedal, the steel bit as well. So I pushed it home, but it was late so, I sort of fixed it, but it was sort of dark so I couldn’t see properly what I’d done, and I was doing the early shift next morning. I got on the bike, but what I’d done, instead of the pedals going sort of alternative, the two pedals went round together, so I had to get to work, so I didn’t have time, so I’ll just go on it anyway, so I was just like… I looked a bit like a kangaroo, because I was pedalling both together. If you can imagine, it’s a bit difficult telling it, without being able to show what I mean. Think of a kangaroo going along the road, that was me. And quickly there was another one, where I was biking along again, and the seat started sort of just going down, so I ended up with the handlebars nearly above my head. So I got rid of the bike after that because I don’t think we really go together. I think I was born with dementia you know, because things are only going to get worse I think. Anyway, hope I’ve made you smile again and I’ll do the 5th one tomorrow. I bet you’re all fed up but only 2 more to go. Ok, Bye.",
